# Euclidean PWM

Generates PWM duty cycles using the Greatest Common Divisor algorithm because why use timers when you can suffer?

## Features
✅ Works on any platform with basic math  
✅ Uses excessive RAM and CPU for simple tasks  
✅ Teaches number theory through blinking  
✅ Not suitable for real applications  
✅ But it's *correct*, dammit

## Requirements
- One (1) microcontroller  
- Willingness to ignore all best practices  
- At least 64 bytes of RAM (preferably 20,000+)  
- A soul you no longer need

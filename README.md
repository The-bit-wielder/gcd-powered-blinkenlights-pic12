# Euclidean PWM

Generates PWM duty cycles using the Greatest Common Divisor algorithm because why use timers when you can suffer?

## Features
✅ Works on any platform with basic math  
✅ Uses excessive RAM and CPU for simple tasks  
✅ Teaches number theory through blinking  
✅ Not suitable for real applications  
✅ But it's *correct*, dammit

## Requirements
- One (1) microcontroller  
- Willingness to ignore all best practices  
- At least 64 bytes of RAM (preferably 20,000+)  
- A soul you no longer need
- 
## Performance
- **Mathematical elegance:** 100/100
- **Practical utility:** 0/100  
- **RAM usage:** Yes
- **CPU cycles:** All of them

## Real-World Applications
- Impressing mathematicians at parties
- Making embedded engineers cry
- Proving that just because you *can*, doesn't mean you *should*

## Warning
Do not use in:
- Production systems
- Safety-critical applications
- Situations where efficiency matters
- Your sanity's best interest

## PS:
This code was made for a PIC12F629 , but if it runs on that... well it runs on a fried potato.
